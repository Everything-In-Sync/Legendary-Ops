                    severable or invalid, or if any term, condition, phrase or portion of this agreement shall be<br>
                    determined to be unlawful or otherwise unenforceable, the remainder of this agreement shall
                    remain<br>
                    in full force and effect, so long as the clause severed does not affect the intent of the
                    parties.<br>
                    If a court should find that any provision of this agreement to be invalid or unenforceable, but
                    that<br>
                    by limiting said provision it would become valid and enforceable, then said provision shall be<br>
                    deemed to be written, construed and enforced as so limited.<br>
