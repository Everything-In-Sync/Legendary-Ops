        In order to ensure that Legendary Ops is the safest and most fun laser tag experience you can have, we have a
        few
        ground rules that all participants must follow.
    </h1>
    <h2>Our basic laser tag rules and regulations are:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>No Running</li>
        <li>No Climbing</li>
        <li>No Physical Contact Between Players</li>
        <li>Hold Laser with Both Hands</li>
    </ul>
</div>
    Players must be careful maneuvering around arena walls, obstacles and each other
    Legendary Ops will not tolerate any running, climbing or personal contact in the arena. There is a zero-tolerance
    policy for this rule. If at any time the players of any age or any group do not follow the rules and regulations of
    Legendary Ops, they will be ejected immediately. If any one player is running, climbing or making overt physical
    contact, the game will be ended immediately without warning.
    These are the Rules of Play quick reference. By reading them you are accepting them and agreeing to abide by them.
    The full set of rules, terms and conditions is available at the event HQ, online at www.legendaryops.com and must be
    agreed to prior to playing.
